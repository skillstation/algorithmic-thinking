# ðŸ”„ Inverse of a Matrix â€“ Programming Question

## Question:

Write a program in any programming language of your choice to find the **inverse** of a given square matrix. The program should:

1. Take a square matrix as input.
2. Check if the matrix is invertible (i.e., determinant â‰  0).
3. Compute and output the inverse.
4. Include at least two test cases.

## Example:

If the input matrix is:

```
Matrix A = [[4, 7],
            [2, 6]]
```

The output should be:

```
Inverse = [[0.6, -0.7],
           [-0.2, 0.4]]
```

## Hint:
- A matrix is invertible only if its determinant is not zero.
- You can use formulas for 2x2 matrices or functions like `numpy.linalg.inv()` for larger ones.
