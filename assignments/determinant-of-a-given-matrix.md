# ðŸ§® Determinant of a Matrix â€“ Programming Question

## Question:

Write a program in any programming language of your choice to compute the **determinant** of a given square matrix. The program should:

1. Take a square matrix as input.
2. Calculate its determinant.
3. Output the determinant value.
4. Include at least two test cases.

## Example:

If the input matrix is:

```
Matrix A = [[1, 2],
            [3, 4]]
```

The output should be:

```
Determinant = -2
```

## Hint:
- The determinant of a 2x2 matrix `[ [a, b], [c, d] ]` is calculated as `ad - bc`.
- For larger matrices, you can use recursion or library functions like `numpy.linalg.det()` in Python.
