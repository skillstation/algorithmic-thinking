### ðŸ§  **Framed Question: Matrix Addition Program**

**Question:**

Write a program in any programming language of your choice to add two matrices of the same size. The program should:

1. Take two matrices as input.
2. Add the corresponding elements.
3. Output the resulting matrix.
4. Include at least two test cases.

---

**Example:**

If the input matrices are:

```
Matrix A = [[1, 2], 
            [3, 4]]

Matrix B = [[5, 6], 
            [7, 8]]
```

The output should be:

```
Result = [[6, 8],
          [10, 12]]
```

**Hint:**  
You can use nested loops to iterate through each row and column. Make sure both matrices have the same dimensions before adding them.
