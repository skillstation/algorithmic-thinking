### ðŸ§  **Framed Question: Matrix Multiplication Program**

**Question:**

Write a program in any programming language of your choice to multiply two matrices. The program should:

1. Take two matrices as input.
2. Perform matrix multiplication (not element-wise).
3. Output the resulting matrix.
4. Include at least two test cases.

---

**Example:**

If the input matrices are:

```
Matrix A = [[1, 2], 
            [3, 4]]

Matrix B = [[5, 6], 
            [7, 8]]
```

The output should be:

```
Result = [[19, 22],
          [43, 50]]
```

**Hint:**  
To multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. Use three nested loops to compute the dot product of corresponding row and column pairs.
